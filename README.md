# Ola-90DaysOfDevOps
Hello! My name is Olamilekan and currently I am learning about Cloud and DevOps engineering. However, decided to take a 90 Days of DevOps challenge and document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps. I will be starting this journey on the 18th April 2022.

The goal is to take 90 days, a few hours a day to enhance my skills in various DevOps areas.

This journey will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and experience various technologies in DevOps. I will also be using at MichaelCade repo to aid my journey. This is the link to the [REPO](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps)
